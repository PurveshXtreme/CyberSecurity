# Information Security & Cybersecurity – Notes

## Infosec (Information Security)
**Information Security (InfoSec)** → Practice of protecting information from:
- Unauthorized access
- Unauthorized use
- Disruption
- Modification
- Destruction

**ISMS** → Information Security Management System

---

## CIA Triad
1. **Confidentiality** → Information access only to authorized users  
2. **Integrity** → Information is complete, accurate, and unaltered  
3. **Availability** → Information must be accessible when needed  

---

## Important Regulations
- **GDPR** – General Data Protection Regulation  
- **HIPAA** – Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act  

---

## Information Security vs Cyber Security
- Information Security is a **broader concept**
- Cyber Security is a **subset of Information Security**
- InfoSec protects **all forms of information** (digital & physical)
- Cyber Security protects **digital information only**

---

## Hacking
- Cutting or breaking something using sheer force  
- In computing, it refers to **breaking security controls**

---

## Types of Hackers (BWGSSSCHIA)

- **Black Hat** → Illegal malicious hackers  
- **White Hat** → Ethical hackers  
- **Gray Hat** → Act between black hat and white hat; may hack without permission but not for malicious intent  
- **Script Kiddies** → Beginners with limited technical knowledge  
- **Suicidal Hackers** → Hack without caring about consequences  
- **State-Sponsored Hackers** → Hackers employed by governments  
- **Cyberterrorists** → Use hacking to create fear or disruption, targeting critical infrastructure  
- **Hacktivists** → Hack for political or social causes  
- **Insider Threats** → Employees or trusted insiders who abuse legitimate access  
- **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)** → Highly skilled attackers targeting specific organizations for long periods  

---

## Threats
- **Malware** → Malicious software (virus, worm, ransomware)  
- **Phishing** → Fake emails or messages used to steal passwords and credit card details  
- **Social Engineering** → Manipulating people into revealing confidential information  
- **Denial-of-Service (DoS)** → Overloading systems or networks to make services unavailable  
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)** → Intercepting and altering communication between two parties  
- **SQL Injection** → Exploiting database vulnerabilities to read, modify, or delete data  
- **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities** → Previously unknown software flaw exploited before a patch is available  
  - Zero-day = bug known to hacker, unknown to developer  
- **Data Breaches** → Unauthorized access to sensitive personal or corporate data  
- **IoT Vulnerabilities** → Exploiting weak security in smart devices  
- **Rogue Access Point** → Unauthorized wireless access point allowing network access

## Impacts of Hacking (ROFL)
1. **Reputational Impact** → Loss of trust and brand image  
2. **Operational Impact** → System downtime and business disruption  
3. **Financial Impact** → Cost of repair and loss of revenue  
4. **Legal Impact** → Lawsuits and regulatory penalties  

---

## Elements of Information Security (CIAAN)
1. **Confidentiality**  
2. **Integrity**  
3. **Availability**  
4. **Authenticity** → Ensures identity of users and systems is genuine  
5. **Non-Repudiation** → Ensures a person cannot deny an action performed  

---

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF)
**NIST** – National Institute of Standards and Technology  

**Functions (IPDRRG)**

| Function | Objective |
|--------|-----------|
| Identify | Understand cybersecurity risks |
| Protect | Prevent or limit cybersecurity incidents |
| Detect | Discover cybersecurity incidents |
| Respond | Take action against incidents |
| Recover | Restore operations after incidents |
| Govern | Establish and monitor cybersecurity strategy and policies |

## ISO/IEC 27001 Framework
- **ISO** – International Organization for Standardization  
- **IEC** – International Electrotechnical Commission  

1. **Define the Scope** → Determine the boundaries of the ISMS  
2. **Conduct a Risk Assessment** → Identify threats and vulnerabilities  
3. **Develop Policies and Procedures**  
4. **Implement Controls** → Apply controls to mitigate risks  
   - Controls selected from **ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A**  
5. **Train Employees**  
6. **Monitor and Review**
