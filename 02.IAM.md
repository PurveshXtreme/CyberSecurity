## Identity and Access Management (IAM)

**Identity and Access Management (IAM)** is a security framework that ensures **the right person gets the right access to the right resource at the right time**.

- **Identity** → Who are you?  
  (user, employee, admin, application, service)
- **Access** → What are you allowed to do?  
  (read, write, delete, approve)

IAM is used across:
- Organizations
- Cloud platforms
- Applications
- Networks
- Databases  

to control and secure user access.

---

## Core Components of IAM

### 1. Identity
- A user, device, application, or system that requires access
- Represents *who* is requesting access

---

### 2. Authentication
- Process of **verifying the identity** of a user or system
- Confirms *who you are*

**Examples:**
- Username & password
- OTP
- Biometrics
- MFA

---

### 3. Authorization
- Determines **what resources and actions** an authenticated user is allowed
- Grants permissions based on roles or policies

**Examples:**
- Read-only access
- Admin access
- File permissions

---

### 4. IGA (Identity Governance & Administration)
- Ensures access is:
  - Appropriate
  - Approved
  - Periodically reviewed
- Helps with **compliance and audits**

---

### 5. SOD (Segregation of Duties)
- Ensures **critical or conflicting tasks** are divided among multiple users
- Prevents fraud and misuse of privileges

**Example:**  
The same user should not both approve and execute payments.

---

### 6. CIAM (Customer Identity & Access Management)
- Manages identities and access for **external users**
- Includes:
  - Customers
  - Partners
  - Vendors

---

### 7. Privileged Access Management (PAM)
- Secures and monitors **high-privilege accounts**
- Focuses on:
  - Admin users
  - Root accounts
  - Superuser access

---

### 8. Single Sign-On (SSO)
- Allows users to authenticate **once**
- Provides access to **multiple applications**
- Improves usability and security

---

### 9. Accounting (Audit, Logging, and Monitoring)
- Tracks and records user activities
- Answers *what actions were performed*

**Examples:**
- Login/logout logs
- Resource access logs
- Privilege change logs

---

## Core Responsibilities of an IAM System

![IAM Core Responsibilities](img/IAMresponsibilities.png)

1. Verify and authenticate individuals based on roles and contextual information  
   (location, time, trusted networks)

2. Capture and record user login events

3. Manage and maintain visibility of the organization’s user identity database

4. Manage assignment and removal of user access privileges

5. Enable administrators to control, restrict, and monitor user access and privilege changes

## IAM Policies

An **IAM Policy** is a set of rules that defines:

- **Who** can access a resource  
- **What actions** they can perform  
- **On which resources**  

IAM policies are used to **control and enforce access permissions** securely.

---

## Core Components of an IAM Policy

1. **Subject (Who)**  
   - The user, role, group, or system requesting access

2. **Action (What)**  
   - The operation being performed  
   - Examples: read, write, delete, update

3. **Resource (On What)**  
   - The object or service being accessed  
   - Examples: file, database, server, application

4. **Effect (Allow / Deny)**  
   - Specifies whether access is permitted or blocked

5. **Condition (When / How)**  
   - Optional rules that control access based on context  
   - Examples: time, location, IP address, device type

---

![IAM Policies](img/iampolicies.png)

---

## Types of IAM Policies

### 1. Identity-Based Policies
- Attached directly to **users, groups, or roles**
- Define what actions an identity can perform

**Example:**  
A user allowed to read and write files but not delete them.

---

### 2. Resource-Based Policies
- Attached directly to a **resource**
- Specify which identities can access the resource

**Example:**  
A storage bucket policy allowing access to a specific user.

---

### 3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Policies
- Access is granted based on **roles**
- Users inherit permissions assigned to their role

**Example:**  
Admin, Manager, and Employee roles with different privileges.

---

### 4. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
- Access decisions based on **attributes**
- Attributes may include:
  - User attributes
  - Resource attributes
  - Environment conditions

**Example:**  
Allow access only if user department = HR and access time = working hours.

---

### 5. Privileged Access Policies
- Control access to **high-privilege accounts**
- Used to protect admin and root-level access

**Example:**  
Restricting admin access to specific systems and time windows.

---

## IAM Lifecycle (Identity and Access Management)

The **IAM Lifecycle** defines how a user’s **digital identity and access rights** are **created, managed, monitored, and removed** across systems during their association with an organization.

It ensures **secure, controlled, and compliant access** throughout a user’s journey.

---

## Stages of the IAM Lifecycle

### 1. Identity Creation
- Creation of a **digital identity** for a new user
- Identity may represent:
  - Employee
  - Contractor
  - Partner
  - Service or application

**Example:**  
Creating a user ID and email address for a new employee.

---

### 2. Provisioning (Access Assignment)
- Assigning access rights based on:
  - Role
  - Department
  - Job function
- Access is granted to required systems and applications

**Example:**  
Granting HR systems access to an HR employee.

---

### 3. Authentication (Identity Verification)
- Verifies the identity of the user during login
- Confirms *who the user is*

**Examples:**
- Password
- OTP
- Biometrics
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

---

### 4. Authorization (Access Enforcement)
- Determines **what actions** the authenticated user can perform
- Enforces permissions and access policies

**Example:**  
Allowing a user to read files but not delete them.

---

### 5. Access Review & Monitoring (Governance Phase)
- Regular review of user access rights
- Monitoring user activities to detect misuse
- Ensures compliance with security policies

**Example:**  
Quarterly review of employee access privileges.

---

### 6. Privileged Access Management (PAM)
- Manages and secures **high-privilege accounts**
- Applies stricter controls for admins and root users

**Example:**  
Monitoring and limiting admin access to critical systems.

---

### 7. Identity Modification (Mover Phase)
- Updates access when a user’s role or department changes
- Old access is removed and new access is assigned

**Example:**  
Employee promoted from Developer to Manager.

---

### 8. De-Provisioning (Leaver Phase)
- Removal of all access when a user leaves the organization
- Prevents unauthorized access after exit

**Example:**  
Disabling user accounts after employee resignation.

---

### 9. Audit, Compliance & Reporting
- Maintaining logs and reports for audits
- Demonstrates compliance with regulations and policies
- Supports forensic analysis

**Example:**  
Providing access logs during a security audit.

---

## Summary

- IAM Lifecycle manages identities **from onboarding to offboarding**
- Reduces security risks and unauthorized access
- Ensures compliance and accountability
- Supports secure and efficient access management
