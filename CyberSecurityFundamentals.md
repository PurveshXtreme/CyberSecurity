# Introduction to Information Security

## What is Information Security?

**Information Security (InfoSec)** is the practice of protecting information from:

- Unauthorized access  
- Unauthorized use  
- Unauthorized disclosure  
- Disruption  
- Modification  
- Destruction  

It ensures that information remains **safe, accurate, and available** only to authorized users.

## Core Objectives – CIA Triad

Information Security is based on three fundamental principles called the **CIA Triad**:

### 1. Confidentiality
- Ensures that information is accessible only to authorized users
- Prevents unauthorized data exposure

**Examples:**
- Password protection
- Encryption
- Access control

### 2. Integrity
- Ensures that information is accurate, complete, and unaltered
- Prevents unauthorized modification of data

**Examples:**
- Hashing
- Digital signatures
- Version control

### 3. Availability
- Ensures that information is accessible when needed
- Prevents system downtime and service disruption

**Examples:**
- Backups
- Redundant systems
- DDoS protection

## Example

Protecting login credentials so that:
- Only the rightful user can access them (**Confidentiality**)
- Credentials are not tampered with (**Integrity**)
- The login system is available 24/7 (**Availability**)

## Why is Information Security Important?

Information Security is critical because modern organizations rely heavily on data and digital systems.

### Key Reasons

### 1. Safeguards Sensitive Data
Protects:
- Personal data
- Financial records
- Health information

Prevents data leaks and misuse.

### 2. Prevents Identity Theft and Fraud
- Stops attackers from stealing credentials and personal details
- Protects users from financial and reputational loss

### 3. Protects Business Assets and Reputation
- Prevents loss of intellectual property
- Maintains customer trust
- Avoids financial penalties due to breaches

### 4. Ensures Legal and Regulatory Compliance
- Helps organizations comply with security laws and regulations

**Examples:**
- GDPR – General Data Protection Regulation
- HIPAA – Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act

### 5. Ensures Business Continuity
- Prevents service downtime
- Protects systems from cyber attacks and disasters

## Example

A healthcare organization encrypting patient records:
- Protects patient privacy
- Prevents unauthorized access
- Complies with HIPAA regulations

## Information Security vs Cyber Security

| Aspect | Information Security | Cyber Security |
|------|----------------------|---------------|
| Scope | Protects all forms of information (digital & physical) | Protects digital systems and networks |
| Data Type | Digital + physical data (files, papers) | Digital data only |
| Focus | Policies, processes, and protection of information | Protection against cyber attacks |
| Examples | Data encryption, access control, physical security | Firewalls, malware protection, IDS/IPS |

## Key Difference

- **Information Security** is a broader concept
- **Cyber Security** is a subset of Information Security
